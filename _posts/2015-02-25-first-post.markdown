Welcome to [cryptopocalyp.se]({{site.url}})! This is Zach Price, and you're on my website.
The plan is for the occasional personal post, accompanied by some (hopefully) educational content.

Topics are likely to range from mathematics and cryptography to opinions on software, life, and governance.
Views presented are certainly my own with no claims of objectivity. Except for the mathematics of course, and even that assumes I make no significant mistakes or omissions.

So far, I have ideas for a couple series on [Goodstein's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodstein%27s_theorem) and the [Leech lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leech_lattice), as I find they make interesting starting points for covering a few branches of mathematics.

Stay tuned! Any corrections or suggestions can be sent to me by email or via social media.
