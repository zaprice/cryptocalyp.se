I've begun my first few entries on Goodstein's theorem, but I want to pause to consider rigour, intuition and narrative in mathematical writing.

### Rigour
In mathematics, **rigour** is an informal term for the amount of work done to demonstrate the truth of a statement in relation to the your assumptions.

In planar geometry you must assume many things; the existence of points, lines, angles, and circles go without question.
You assume that first-order logic exists and behaves the way you expect.
You assume that constructions are possible, and that certain quantities can be held equal (e.g. lengths of lines, spans of angles).
From here, the proof of a geometric theorem can be demonstrated to result directly from your assumptions, or _axioms_.

A proof that includes detailed explanations of each step is more rigorous, whereas one that leaves out tedious calculations or casually omits non-trivial leaps of logic is less so.
Most of the time, we tend towards the middle; small calculations or derivations are left to the mind of the reader, subtleties are outlined in sufficient detail, and emphasis is placed on the most relevant parts of the problem.

### Intuition

Rigour is good; it is one feature that makes mathematics a transcendent and intellectually fulfilling endeavor.
However, I find that rigour and brevity are usually chosen over narrative and intuition.  
**Intuition** is the way you conceive of and reason about an object in the abstract, undistracted by the specifics of definitions and theorems.
Intuitions are difficult to express in writing, and the medium of the mathematical paper is not conducive to open-ended, imprecise explanations.
Discussion of intuition is a great benefit of attending a lecture or having a conversation about a problem; we tend to speak more freely and less precisely than we write.

In topology, open sets are at the heart of everything, and they have a terse, axiomatic definition.
However, the **idea** that the open set attempts to convey is one of _closeness_.  
Two points are _close_ together, in an imprecise sense, if there is some open set containing both of them.
An open neighborhood of a point is a set of things _close_ to that point.
On the real line, open intervals play the role of open sets; one can see how a small open interval about zero is a set of things _close_ to zero.

More generally, when we reason abstractly about the plausibility of some conjecture, this intuition is what we use.
What does this space _look_ like? What is _close_ to this point? _Where_ are these two neighborhoods located, and how do they interact?
This thought process is usually accompanied with sloppy pictures, to express and explore the relevant objects in the abstract: an amorphous figure as a topological space, dots as points, imperfect circles as open sets.
We do this to explore the **feeling** of the problem, to figure out what is possible, what is relevant, and what is obviously untrue.
Only after that do we begin to break things down more systematically.
Exploration is an important step in mathematical inquiry, and intuition enables that exploration.

### Narrative

**Narrative** is my own term for expository mathematical writing primarily concerned with conveying some notion, analogy, connection, or intuition to the reader.
Papers, as published in journals, tend to contain almost no narrative, and textbooks usually contain little.  
Without narrative, the relentless precision of mathematics can often result in readers being _distracted by the details_; we get caught up in memorizing definitions and scrutinizing proofs, losing sight of the higher levels of intuition and meta-problem solving.

Since this is a blog and not a journal, I will be taking my own approach to incorporating narrative into mathematics.
My primary focus will be _imparting intuition_ to the reader, even if this means I have to be verbose and inelegant.

Moreover, I want my posts to be accessible enough that someone who is less familiar with standard mathematical tools will still be able to understand the big picture.  
**Mathematics is beautiful**, but most of us will never see that because the practice of mathematics is sometimes daunting or tedious.
However, most mathematical ideas can be exposed in such a way that anyone who can handle logical reasoning can grasp the core ideas that make particular topics fascinating or interesting.

This doesn't mean I will disregard rigour entirely.
My plan is to include reasonable proofs for everything that isn't entirely tangential.
I will likely experiment with the format over time; my first idea is to link each post to a secondary one, containing a more rigorous discussion which assumes the reader has some background in standard proof techniques, set theory, etc.
These posts should be self-contained, as long as you follow the series, and any additional prerequisites will be noted.
